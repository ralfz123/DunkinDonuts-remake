# Front-End Development | 2019-2020 | Year 2 of CMD  
This is an assignment where I have to copy a site exactly. Pixel perfect is the principle that I must apply and I am very good at that. In addition, the site had to be Responsive (Mobile and Desktop).

The site I copied is: <a href="https://www.dunkindonuts.nl/donuts/" target="_blank">https://www.dunkindonuts.nl/donuts/</a> (November 2019)

## 🖥 + 📱 Live version 🔴
[Here](https://ralfz123.github.io/DunkinDonuts-remake/index.html) you can admire the live version.

## Changes
- No horizontal scroll
- Focus state set on color (nav & footer)
- Form made
- Cursor pointer when hover over the products
- Detailpage created
